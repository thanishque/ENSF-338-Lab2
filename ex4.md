1. Describe the algorithm you will use to find the room. Assume all the information you have is the one given by the sign; you have no
knowledge of the floor plan.
Start at the entrance and walk straight ahead. Check room numbers as you go. If you encounter a room number between EY100 and EY130, keep walking straight. Otherwise, turn left if the number is smaller or right if it's larger than EY130. Continue until you find room EY128.

2. How many ”steps” it will take to find room EY128? And what is a “step” in this case?
The number of steps to find EY128 depends on the initial location of the entrance relative to the room. If EY128 is directly ahead, it would involve walking straight. Otherwise, it may require turning once or twice at junctions. The exact number of steps can vary, but typically, it won't exceed a few turns or room transitions.

3. Is this a best-case scenario, worst-case scenario, or neither?
This scenario falls under neither the best-case nor the worst-case category because the efficiency of the algorithm depends on the initial position relative to room EY128. Without knowing the starting point, it's challenging to ascertain whether the algorithm will require minimal or maximal steps. In both best and worst-case scenarios, the efficiency would be determined by factors such as proximity to EY128 from the entrance. Therefore, due to the lack of specific information about the starting position, we cannot definitively categorize it as either best or worst-case.

4. With this particular sign and floor layout, explain what a worst-case or best-case scenario would look like
In the best-case scenario, finding EY128 involves minimal steps as it's directly ahead from the entrance. This scenario allows for navigation with little changes from the initial path. Conversely, in the worst-case scenario, EY128 is situated at the farthest point from the entrance, necessitating traversing through numerous rooms, leading to a prolonged journey. These scenarios represent extremes in efficiency, with the best-case scenario offering optimal accessibility and the worst-case scenario presenting a significant challenge in navigation.

5. Suppose after a few weeks in the term you memorize the layout of the floor. How would you improve the algorithm to make it more efficient?
With a memorized layout, the algorithm can prioritize the shortest path to EY128, leveraging landmarks and distinctive features for efficient navigation. Utilizing shortest paths from the entrance to EY128 minimizes unnecessary steps, enhancing efficiency. By incorporating these strategies, the algorithm streamlines the process of locating EY128 within the building, optimizing the overall navigation experience.
